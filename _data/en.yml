  paragraph1:     "The Cash in Emergencies Toolkit is organized in modules, each corresponding to a different phase of the project cycle."
  paragraph2:     "Each module is divided in steps and sub-steps. They are indicative and not necessarily sequential. The user may need to move back and forth to reach the intended results. The user may also need to skip some of the steps or sub-steps proposed, due to time and resource constraints that are common in an emergency context."
